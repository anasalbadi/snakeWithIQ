# We are trying to test how easily is Artificial Intelligence 
# beating us at our own games?

# A good background on Reinforcement learning:
# machine learning technique used to train an agent
# agent = the entity being trained to act upon its environment
# using rewards and punishments to teach positive versus negative
# behaviour. 

# Breakdown:
1. Implement the game and setup the environment
2. Create the Neural Network
3. Implement and Train the Agent

# Packages you need:
1. NumPy: A python library used for working with arrays
2. Matplotlib: Helps plot and create visualizations of data
3. Pytorch: A machine learning framework that helps create neural networks
4. Pygame: Python module designed for video games

# Found Issue with using system variables and trying to solve that at the moment
